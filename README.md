Throughout my career I have been tasked with analyzing data to assess trends, create goals and make decisions in the interest of my employer and all relevant stakeholders. Additionally, I have extensive experience using Microsoft Excel, which helps me visualize data and assists my employer with remaining in compliance at both the State and Federal level.

With an interest in data collection and analysis, I started researching the relevant tools and terminology commonly used by professionals within the field, including Tableau, Customer Relationship Management ("CRM") databases, as well as Relational database management system Software (SQL).
